# ShabbatMovieLauncher

## Goal
This is a desktop app to schedule a time where a movie is automatically played. For those who don't use electronics on Shabbat, this is a solution to still watch a movie (ask you local lenient rabbi).
## Features
You chose the streaming url to the movie, and set the schedule. 
## Disclaimers
It works specifically for my pc with chrome. I have not done a wide range of tests so it may not work on your computer. I mainly just wanted something basic to work for me. There is a lot of room for improvement I may or may not get to.
